# SP21-G3-personality-quiz

A very cheesy personality quiz in the style of the infamous "BuzzFeed" quizzes.
Coded by Zavier Mattson and Stephen "Drake" Stelljes, Spring 2021.

There will be a series of asinine questions each acompanied by a questionably-relevant image, and upon the completion of all questions, your results will be assigned based on
what you answered! We have not come up with what the theme of the quiz is yet, but some examples of what might be chosen are "What superhero are you?", "What game console are you?"
"What food are you?", etc.

We will implement a progress bar to indicate how far you are through the quiz.
