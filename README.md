# SP21-G3-personality-quiz

A very cheesy personality quiz in the style of the infamous "BuzzFeed" quizzes.
Coded by Zavier Mattson and Stephen "Drake" Stelljes, Spring 2021.

There will be a series of asinine questions each acompanied by a questionably-relevant image, and upon the completion of all questions, your results will be assigned based on
what you answered! The topic for our quiz is "What spring activity are you?" Possible activites are:

Outdoor Barbecue

Playing Frisbee

Hiking in the mountains

Horseback riding

Gardening

We will implement a progress bar to indicate how far you are through the quiz.
